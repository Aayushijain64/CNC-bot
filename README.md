This project can draw or write as you want. It is integrated with an android app where as you state the font face and size, in the same font the text is printed on the paper. It can be used to help making standard posters and wall sheets where we want it to be handwritten. The Android app is also integrated with speech to text api which makes it a great help to handicapped students who can just write text by there speech. Thus its a great help to the community and normal class people.
